# This is my submission of Step8Up week-1 challenge.

## what I have learned

+ Importance of arranging Divs/Sections well before applying CSS to them. // doing it mid project was way harder.
+ Next time I will be arranging placement and nesting of divs with basic Css styling prior to applying styles

+ I need to practice more with utilising positioning with Block, In-line
+ Flex and in-lineflex are very useful but I want to understand the basic displays better.

+ I feel my understanding of Padding, and Margins are much more effective.
